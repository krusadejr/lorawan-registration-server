## If the Application Won't Start

### Step 1: Try the DEBUG Version
- Double-click: `DEBUG_START.bat`
- This will show error messages that help diagnose the problem
- Take note of any error text and share with support

### Step 2: Check Port 5000
- The application uses port 5000
- If another application is using it, close it first
- Or wait 30 seconds and try again

### Step 3: Windows Security
- You may see "Windows protected your PC" warning
- Click "More info" then "Run anyway" to continue
- This is normal for executables not from the Microsoft Store

### Step 4: First Launch May Be Slow
- The application initializes databases and systems on first run
- Wait 15-20 seconds before opening the browser
